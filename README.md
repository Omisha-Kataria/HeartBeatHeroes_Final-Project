# HeartBeat Heroes - Final Project for INFO 5100 - Fall'24

## Introduction

The global blood supply faces a critical challenge — there simply isn’t enough available blood to meet the needs of patients across all blood types. This problem is particularly acute in low-income countries, where logistical inefficiencies exacerbate shortages, leading to unmet demand and unnecessary waste. Interestingly, the United States has become a global leader in safe blood collection and is home to the majority of willing blood donors, making it a central player in addressing worldwide shortages.

**HeartBeat Heroes** aims to bridge these gaps. Our application is designed to handle online blood requests efficiently and ensure safe storage and delivery using cutting-edge technology for quality control and flexible inventory management.

## Problem Statement

How can we create a scalable and efficient platform that connects global blood donors with patients in need, eliminates wastage, and ensures reliable transportation and quality control?

## Solution

HeartBeat Heroes is a user-friendly, globally scalable platform that connects donors and beneficiaries while addressing the challenges of blood storage, transportation, and distribution. Its modular design allows it to scale seamlessly across different regions, ensuring reliability and adaptability to various medical ecosystems.

## Assumptions

To make HeartBeat Heroes successful, we base the project on the following global and operational assumptions:

1. **Free Blood Trade Agreement**: All UN countries agree to unrestricted blood trade across borders.
2. **International Funding**: Blood transportation is fully funded under an international agreement.
3. **Local Clinic Integration**: Hospitals and clinics worldwide can join the HeartBeat Heroes network. Participating clinics will receive training to use the app and adhere to standardized quality control protocols.

## User Characteristics

HeartBeat Heroes serves the following users:

- **Donors**: Any qualified adult who meets health requirements.
- **Beneficiaries**: Patients with a medical prescription for blood or their official guardians/emergency contacts.

## Key Features

1. **Streamlined Onboarding**: Users don’t need an account for initial access, reducing barriers to entry.
2. **Donor Workflow**: Donors fill out a form with their location, contact details, and a Personal Identification Number (PIN). If eligible, they receive details about donation procedures and appointments.
3. **Beneficiary Workflow**: Beneficiaries provide their location, blood type, required volume, and prescription details. They are matched with nearby in-network clinics.
4. **Case Management**: Each user’s request is assigned a dedicated case manager to oversee the process from start to finish.

## Operational Workflow

HeartBeat Heroes streamlines every stage of the blood donation lifecycle:

1. **Donor Screening**: Lab checks are conducted to ensure donor eligibility.
2. **Authorization**: Government agencies verify pending requests.
3. **Logistics**: The platform coordinates safe and timely blood transportation.

## Global Scalability

HeartBeat Heroes is built for growth. Its modular programming design allows functions to operate independently, making it easy to adapt the app for different regions and expand its reach. Our approach not only supports global scaling but also ensures that every participating clinic or organization operates cohesively within the HeartBeat Heroes network.
